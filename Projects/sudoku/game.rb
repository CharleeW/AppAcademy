# Game
# The Game should have an instance variable for the Board. 
# It should also have methods for managing the Board-Player 
# interaction. You may want a play loop that runs until the 
# puzzle is solved. Inside the loop, you should render the board, 
# prompt the player for input, and then get both a pos and a value 
# from the player. It should then update the tile at pos with the new 
# value. I wrote helper methods to get and validate input from the user; 
# this should help keep our program from crashing. :)
